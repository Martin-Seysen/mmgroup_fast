This is the Python ``mmgroup_fast`` project.

It is a supplement to the ``mmgroup`` project that provides
performance-critical components for accelerating computations in the
Monster group. Users must compile the source files of this project
themselves.

Users who simply want to perform computations in the Monster group are
advised to use the mmgroup project instead:
